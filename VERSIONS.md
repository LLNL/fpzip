# fpzip Release Notes


## 1.3.0 (December 20, 2019)

- Released code under a BSD license.

## 1.1.0 (June 8, 2014)

- Modified API to pass arguments via a parameter object (FPZ).

- Modified API to support reading the header before decompressing the

  on the command line.

- Added support for specifying the precision in increments of one
  (floats) or two (doubles) bits for lossy compression.

- Added support for data sets larger than 4 GB.

- Added compile-time support for excluding header information, e.g.
  for in-memory compression of many small arrays.

- Modified API to use size_t in place of unsigned int where appropriate.

- Changed error handling to set fpzip_errno instead of writing to
  stderr and aborting.

- Added more functionality to the testfpzip example program.


## 1.0.1 (August 7, 2008)

- Added modes for bitwise type conversions beyond reinterpret_cast,
  which caused aliasing problems with gcc 4.1.2.
