**                               SUMMARY
**
** fpzip is a library for lossless or lossy compression of 2D and 3D arrays
** of single- or double-precision floating-point scalars.  Although linear
** (1D) streams of scalars may be compressed as well, the library has
** primarily been designed to exploit higher-dimensional structure in the
** data.  fpzip may not perform well on 1D data or on data not stored as a
** spatially correlated contiguous array, with 'smoothly' varying values.
**
** The library supports compression to either a file or to main memory and
** allows specifying how many bits of precision to retain by truncating
** each floating-point value and discarding the least significant bits; the
** remaining bits are compressed losslessly.  The precision is limited to
** integers 2-32 for floats.  For doubles, precisions 4-64 are supported in
** increments of two bits.  The decompressed data is returned in full
** precision with any truncated bits zeroed.
**
** Because floating-point arithmetic may be affected by factors such as
** register precision, rounding mode, and compiler optimizations,
** precautions have been taken to ensure correctness and portability via a
** set of compile-time macros.  For example, it is possible to specify that
** floating-point operations be emulated via integer arithmetic, or to
** treat the binary representation of floating-point numbers as integers.
** Please consult the Config file for choosing among these settings.  The
** compressor works correctly on the IEEE 754 floating-point format, though
** no particular assumption is made on the floating-point representation
** other than the most significant bit being the sign bit.  Special values
** such as infinities, NaNs, and subnormal numbers should be handled
** correctly by the compressor in lossless mode.
**
** For convenience, functions are provided for reading and writing a header
** that stores version specific information and metadata such as array
** dimensions.  Such metadata must be provided to both compressor and
** decompressor.  It is up to the caller to decide whether or not to use
** such fpzip headers, as this information may already be available
** externally from container formats like HDF5.  If fpzip headers are not
** used, then the FPZ fields must be set by the caller in both read and
** write mode.
**
** A single compressed stream may store multiple contiguous fields (e.g.,
** for multiple arrays with the same dimensions that represent different
** variables).  Similarly, a stream may store multiple arrays of different
** dimensions and types, possibly with one header per array.  It is up to
** the caller to interleave read/write calls that perform (de)compression
** of floating-point data with read/write calls of header data.
**
** The return value of each function should be checked in case invalid
** arguments are passed or a run-time error occurs.  In this case, the
** variable fpzip_errno is set and can be examined to determine the cause
** of the error.
**
** fpzip is distributed as Open Source under a BSD-3 license.  The core
** library is written in C++ and applications need to be linked with a C++
** linker.  The library can, however, be called from C.  For further
** information, please e-mail fpzip@llnl.gov.
